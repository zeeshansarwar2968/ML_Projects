# Python Matplotlib Scatterplot Exercises

> 1. Write a Python program to draw a scatter graph taking a random distribution in X and Y and
> plotted against each other.
> 
> 2. Write a Python program to draw a scatter plot with empty circles taking a random distribution
> in X and Y and plotted against each other.
> 
> 3. Write a Python program to draw a scatter plot using random distributions to generate balls of
> different sizes.
> 
> 4. Write a Python program to draw a scatter plot comparing two subject marks of Mathematics
> and Science. Use marks of 10 students.\
> Test Data:\
> math_marks = [88, 92, 80, 89, 100, 80, 60, 100, 80, 34]\
> science_marks = [35, 79, 79, 48, 100, 88, 32, 45, 20, 30]\
> marks_range = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
> 
> 5. Write a Python program to draw a scatter plot for three different groups camparing weights
> and heights.
